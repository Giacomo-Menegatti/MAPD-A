# MAPD-A
Project for the laboratory of the course Management and Analysis of Physics Dataset mod.A a.a. 24/24
The final project of the course consisted in creating a simple CPU called SAP (Simple As Possible) 
and running a simple program on it. My group project consisted in creating an Arduino sketch 
to automatically load data on the SAP RAM. 
This project has been done in Arduino IDE first and then using a Jupyter Notebook interfaced with Arduino with the library FIRMATA
